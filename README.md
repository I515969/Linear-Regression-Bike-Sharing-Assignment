General Information
Boom bike a popular bike sharing company is going under dip in their business during covid times and now it wants to understand the parameters that can be used predict the demand so that company can focus on the business once the Pandemic end.

This project analyzed the data shared by the boom bike and the conclussion is shared in the next section.

Conclusions
From Data it is very clear that the business is increased significantly from 2018 to 2019 which indicates there is a great demand for the boom bike.
Parameters like temperature, season, weathersituation, monthly and yearly data analzyed
Multiple linear regression algorithm is applied and following inference were derived:
Training data has R-squared value as 83.6%
Testing data has R-squared value as 79.56%
Error terms normally distributed around zero validating key assumption of linear regression
This shows model is a good fit and not overfitting 
Variables like:Temperature, season, and weather condition are highly relevant and plays major role in the business.
Multicollinearity was successfully addressed, with all VIF values below 5 in the final model, ensuring reliable coefficient estimates.
Technologies Used
